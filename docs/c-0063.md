## Description of the the issue
Attackers who have relevant RBAC permissions, can run open a backdoor communication channel directly to the sockets inside target container using exec command “kubectl portforward” command. Using this method, attackers can bypass network security restrictions and communicate directly with software in the containers.

## What does this control test
Check which subjects have RBAC permissions to portforward into pods– if they have the “pods/portforward” resource.
 
## Remediation
It is recommended to prohibit “kubectl portforward” command in production environments. It is also recommended not to use subjects with this permission for daily cluster operations.
