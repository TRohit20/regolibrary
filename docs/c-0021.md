## Description of the the issue
Exposing a sensitive interface to the internet poses a security risk. Some popular frameworks were not intended to be exposed to the internet, and therefore donâ€™t require authentication by default. Thus, exposing them to the internet allows unauthenticated access to a sensitive interface which might enable running code or deploying containers in the cluster by a malicious actor. Examples of such interfaces that were seen exploited include Apache NiFi, Kubeflow, Argo Workflows, Weave Scope, and the Kubernetes dashboard.

## What does this control test
Checking if a service of type nodeport/loadbalancer to one of the known exploited interfaces (Apache NiFi, Kubeflow, Argo Workflows, Weave Scope Kubernetes dashboard) exists. Needs to add user config
 
## Remediation
Consider blocking external interfaces or protect them with appropriate security tools.
 
## Example
No example
