## Description of the the issue
Network policies control traffic flow between Pods, namespaces, and external IP addresses. By default, no network policies are applied to Pods or namespaces, resulting in unrestricted ingress and egress traffic within the Pod network. Pods become isolated through a network policy that applies to the Pod or the Podâ€™s namespace. Once a Pod is selected in a network policy, it rejects any connections that are not specifically allowed by any applicable policy object.Administrators should use a default policy selecting all Pods to deny all ingress and egress traffic and ensure any unselected Pods are isolated. Additional policies could then relax these restrictions for permissible connections.

## What does this control test
Check for each Pod whether there is an ingress and egress policy defined (whether using Pod or Namespace). 
 
## Remediation
Define a network policy that restricts ingress and egress connections.
