## What does this control test
Check whether the readOnlyRootFilesystem field in the SecurityContext is set to true. 
 
## Remediation
Set the filesystem of the container to read-only when possible (POD securityContext, readOnlyRootFilesystem: true). If containers application needs to write into the filesystem, it is recommended to mount secondary filesystems for specific directories where application require write access.
 
## Example
```

```
