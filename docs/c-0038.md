## Framework
NSA, ClusterScan, AllControls, ArmoBest, WorkloadScan
 
## Severity
High

## Description of the the issue
Containers should be isolated from the host machine as much as possible. The hostPID and hostIPC fields in deployment yaml may allow cross-container influence and may expose the host itself to potentially malicious or destructive actions. This control identifies all PODs using hostPID or hostIPC privileges.

## What does this control test
Containers should be isolated from the host machine as much as possible. The hostPID and hostIPC fields in deployment yaml may allow cross-container influence and may expose the host itself to potentially malicious or destructive actions. This control identifies all PODs using hostPID or hostIPC privileges.
 
## Remediation
Remove hostPID and hostIPC from the yaml file(s) privileges unless they are absolutely necessary.
 
## Example
```
